# The vim search pulse

## Description

This plugin is inspired by
https://github.com/LStinson/Vim/blob/master/plugin/pulse.vim and
https://github.com/ivyl/vim-bling following the discussion on
http://redd.it/1o7t2a

For the cursorline to be set only in the active window you may want to install
this plugin: https://github.com/vim-scripts/CursorLineCurrentWindow

When you perform a search, the cursor jumps to the closest match. It's often
hard to locate it's new position. With this plugin the cursor line will "pulse"
thus requiring your eyes attention.

Put `set cursorline` in your .vimrc file.
