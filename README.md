# The vim search pulse

## Description

This plugin is inspired by
https://github.com/LStinson/Vim/blob/master/plugin/pulse.vim and
https://github.com/ivyl/vim-bling following the discussion on
http://redd.it/1o7t2a

For the cursor line to be set only in the active window you may want to install
this plugin: https://github.com/vim-scripts/CursorLineCurrentWindow

When you perform a search, the cursor jumps to the closest match. It's often
hard to locate it's new position. With this plugin the cursor line will "pulse"
thus requiring your eyes attention.

Active the cursor line highlighing by putting `set cursorline` in your .vimrc
file.
